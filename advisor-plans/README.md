# Synara Roadmap Execution Controller

> **Purpose:** Keep execution prompts small. This file controls progress; the detailed,
> evidence-backed specification remains in `audit/README.md`.
>
> **Planned at:** commit `5056e395e`, 2026-07-14.

## Active goal and objective

**Goal:** Implement every remaining row in the consolidated 17-workstream roadmap, in dependency
order, then sweep only those changes. Preserve the authoritative dirty worktree and do not reopen the
original 206-finding audit or add P4/P5 scope.

**Objective:** Finish the remaining release, desktop-security, Git, settings, automation, ACP,
web-state, and provider-metadata authorities. Keep each row on one canonical ownership path, delete
replaced implementations, use focused verification during implementation, and perform one final sweep
after all rows are code-complete.

- Do not open a new roadmap workstream or add a compatibility/fallback path.
- Every runtime phase must delete more LOC than it adds; migrations/recovery are the only exception.
- Preserve tests that prove invariants, but merge redundant fixtures and avoid broad scaffolding.
- ACP work is boundary/deletion planning first; no new `effect-acp` protocol ownership.
- After each pruning phase, record the removed authority, net runtime LOC, focused evidence, and next
  deletion target in this controller and the owning audit finding.

## Source of truth

- `AGENTS.md` owns repository rules.
- `audit/README.md` owns each workstream's evidence, scope, acceptance criteria, STOP
  conditions, dependency graph, and deferred/rejected decisions.
- This file owns execution order, current status, and the next eligible workstream.
- The dirty worktree is authoritative. Never revert or recreate existing changes.

Do not copy the full audit into a prompt. Before working on an item, read only:

1. `AGENTS.md`;
2. this controller;
3. the active workstream in `audit/README.md`;
4. the dependency/order section of `audit/README.md` when needed;
5. the live code and existing diff in that workstream's scope.

## Current pointer

- **State:** `CODE COMPLETE`
- **Active workstream:** none; the shortened 17-workstream controller is implemented.
- **Active phase:** the ACP compatibility-package deletion is implemented. Focused ACP/provider
  gates, conformance, server build, benchmark smoke, and residual checks pass; heavyweight workspace
  verification remains deferred by instruction.
- **Phase boundary:** only the existing 17-workstream controller is in scope. No audit expansion,
  P4/P5 work, or unrelated product roadmap additions.

## Working rules

- Work on one authority/subsystem at a time.
- Do not reopen the audit or add P4/P5 work.
- Preserve behavior unless the active finding explicitly changes it.
- Consolidate duplicated ownership; do not add permanent old/new paths.
- Split large workstreams into reviewable phases under the same ID.
- Do not run builds or broad test suites.
- Do not run `bun fmt`, `bun lint`, or `bun typecheck` without explicit authorization.
- Use only the smallest targeted test/check set when necessary; otherwise record verification as
  deferred. Never run `bun test`; use `bun run test` when a targeted test is authorized.
- Do not install dependencies, commit, stage, push, reset, clean, or rebase unless asked.
- Preserve unrelated user changes in the dirty worktree.
- Do not run overlapping implementation agents in the same checkout.
- State the exact existing path being removed or consolidated before each edit.
- Require net-negative runtime LOC for every pruning phase.
- Stop rather than improvise if a migration risks data loss, accepted provider work may be
  duplicated/lost, a destructive Git action lacks exact identity, or scope crosses into an
  unrelated authority.

## Status meanings

- `TODO`: not started.
- `IN PROGRESS`: a bounded implementation phase is active.
- `CODE COMPLETE`: code and direct inspection are complete; heavyweight verification is
  deferred.
- `DONE`: acceptance criteria and the permitted verification evidence are complete.
- `BLOCKED`: include a one-line blocker and do not work around it implicitly.
- `REJECTED`: current code/evidence proves the workstream is no longer valuable.

Independent items may be reordered only when their dependencies and the audit's
"must not run concurrently" rules remain satisfied.

## Short-list pruning checkpoint (2026-07-14)

No roadmap scope was added. The checkpoint changed only the seven existing rows:

- `P1-DESKTOP-SEC-01`: private random pipe leases, lease-owned tabs/CDP events, bounded clients and
  output, correct browser partition permission denial, denied custom schemes, and sandboxed SVG
  responses. Windows now publishes neither a pipe nor its environment capability until an explicit
  per-user ACL implementation exists; unreachable Windows socket branches were deleted. Phase runtime
  change: **-3 LOC**. Focused evidence: **20/20** desktop/server tests, including the 5/5 pipe helper
  gate in this phase.
- `P1-GIT-01`: one canonical-common-dir mutation coordinator now wraps mutating RPC ingress and the
  existing handoff/PR/stack sagas; stash deletion requires the inspected exact ref. Status and
  numstat now use Git's NUL machine protocol, deleting the quoted-path/rename heuristics (**-3 runtime
  LOC**). The handoff RPC now carries thread/command identity and commits the existing durable
  `thread.meta.update` server-side, deleting the browser's second dispatch, optimistic write, forced
  snapshot, and duplicated request shape (approximately **-4 runtime LOC**). Focused evidence:
  **4/4** mutation/saga tests, **1/1** adversarial-filename status test, and **12/12** handoff
  contract/manager/query tests. Migration 68 now owns the handoff lifecycle: retries reuse stored Git
  results, startup replays `git_applied` metadata, and pre-result interruptions become explicit
  `uncertain` rows instead of rerunning Git. The focused recovery test passes **1/1**; RPC/server
  module imports and the scoped diff check pass.
- `P1-SETTINGS-01`: persisted revision/migration envelope, invalid-file quarantine, atomic commit,
  disk re-read under the write lock, and server-resolved provider launch settings. Focused evidence:
  **4/4** settings tests. Client contracts carry patches rather than revisions, so there is no second
  CAS authority to delete; provider presentation mappings are owned by `P2-PROVIDER-META-01`.
- `P1-AUTO-01`: run insertion and iteration-cap reservation are one transaction; permission snapshots
  capture settings revision and server-resolved options. Dispatchable schedule advancement and
  one-shot disable now share that transaction, including deduped crash recovery; six result tails and
  cancellation use one terminal owner. Recovery exception: approximately **+2 runtime LOC**. Focused
  evidence: prior **113/113** sweep plus **10/10** terminal/schedule gates. Recovery now traverses
  bounded 200-row keyset pages, including the 201st-row integration gate, and the route-level event
  subscription was deleted in favor of the existing sidebar/cache owner. Additional focused evidence:
  **3/3** recovery gates and **32/32** automation UI tests.
- `P2-ACP-01`: the official TypeScript SDK owns framing, JSON-RPC dispatch/correlation, validation,
  and cancellation for Grok, Droid, and Cursor; runtime/event queues are bounded and resume/load no
  longer falls back to a new session. The deprecated constructor and legacy production wire branch
  are deleted; explicit extensions use SDK parsers and raw logging wraps bytes without a second
  parser. The mock agent now uses the official SDK too. The private `effect-acp` client, agent,
  protocol, RPC, terminal, stdio helpers, tests, examples, fixtures, generated compatibility schema,
  and workspace package are deleted. `AcpErrors.ts` and `AcpExtensions.ts` retain only Synara-owned
  runtime policy and non-standard extension decoding. Focused evidence: prior **40/40** and **48/48**
  sweeps plus the current **168/168** ACP/provider gates.
- `P2-WEB-STATE-01`: normalized slices are the only runtime thread authority. The derived `threads`
  property, every transition-side synchronization branch, and the one-way legacy-fixture gate were
  deleted; the two remaining production reads use the existing cached derivation helper. Phase
  runtime change: approximately **-70 LOC**. Focused evidence: prior **212/212** sweep plus **96/96**
  store/selector tests after deletion.
- `P2-PROVIDER-META-01`: one exhaustive shared descriptor owns provider order, display labels,
  picker availability, settings visibility, and usage presentation/support. Three remaining web
  order arrays and the unsafe provider/home usage TTL cache were deleted; health completion checks
  the existing settings revision before publication. Phase runtime change: approximately **-55
  LOC**. Focused evidence: **10/10** ordering/handoff/skills tests and **92/92** provider health/usage
  tests.

Prior sweep: `git diff --check` and residual-ownership searches pass. Focused regression gates pass
**439/439** (server 296, web 138, desktop 5). The repository-wide dirty diff remains large and is not
claimed as net-negative: tracked diff is **+23,908 / -9,254 (net +14,654)**. The shortened checklist
is code-complete except for the Git process-crash durability phase; this
checkpoint does not hide that blocker or create a replacement workstream.

Net-negative consolidation closeout: shared ACP locks, settlement, plan dedupe, logging, and image
attachment loading replace provider-local copies; `wsNativeApi` owns one listener registry/reset
path; three browser files share only their identical server/host fixtures. Runtime-source change for
this closeout is **+426 / -2,943 (net -2,517 LOC)**; total code change including retained tests and
the official mock agent is approximately **net -4,590 LOC**. Focused gates pass **48/48 server** and
**29/29 web unit**. The browser rerun exposed and fixed the missing registry reset operation, then hit
the existing incomplete WebSocket welcome fixture (`protocolEpoch` missing); no replacement scaffold
was added. The residual `effect-acp` schema/error compatibility layer is now deleted. The separately
recorded stdout backpressure gate remains open.

## Dirty worktree reconciliation

- Existing managed-attachment migration/store/cleanup work belongs to `P1-FILE-01`; finish
  that authority before creating any separate file ledger.
- The unnumbered/unregistered delivery migration scaffold and repositories belong to
  `P1-DELIVERY-01`; do not activate or duplicate them before identity/lifecycle/runtime dependencies.
- ACP protocol/conformance changes belong to `P2-ACP-01`; keep them dormant until the
  provider lifecycle and bounded-runtime contracts are stable.
- Existing authentication, WebSocket admission, workspace safety, dependency, frontend,
  and provider changes are preserved under their owning workstreams.
- `P0-REL-01` phase 1 now owns the dirty release workflow/smoke/updater-security diff. Dirty
  package manifests and `bun.lock` are pre-existing dependency remediation and must not be
  rewritten by the release phases.

## Pruning checkpoint progress

- Roadmap expansion is frozen; unopened TODO rows remain frozen.
- The phase-by-phase diary was deleted because it duplicated evidence owned by `audit/README.md`.
- Active deletion targets, in order: duplicated provider/orchestration ownership in the five hotspot
  files; redundant focused-test scaffolding; then the official ACP SDK canary boundary and its exact
  custom-wire deletion map.
- Record only completed pruning phases here: removed path, net runtime LOC, focused evidence, and next
  deletion target.
- `PRUNE-01` — `ProviderCommandReactor` approval/user-input settlement no longer performs a direct
  thread projection read immediately before `resolveProviderSessionThread` repeats the same read. The
  approval error branch also dropped its dead generator tail and repeated stale-error classification.
  Net runtime change: **-8 LOC**. Focused interaction gates pass 2/2. Next: merge the remaining shared
  approval/user-input claim and failure-envelope ownership without changing settlement behavior.
- `PRUNE-02` — the duplicated approval and user-input durable claim, idempotent replay check,
  provider-thread resolution, stopped-session settlement, and activity envelope now have one in-file
  owner. Only the two provider-specific response calls remain separate. Net runtime change:
  **-18 LOC**. Focused approval/user-input claim, forwarding, and stopped-session gates pass 6/6.
  Next: remove duplicated durable-source replay/claim branching without weakening exact-once evidence.
- `PRUNE-03` — the durable source no longer repeats the replay-safe/external claimed-intent expression
  across ordered delivery, quarantine replay, and operator retry. The overlapping external-claim alias
  was replaced by one claimed-intent classifier while replay safety remains separately classified for
  expiry handling. Net runtime change: **-7 LOC**. Focused durable-delivery classification gates pass
  5/5. Next: inspect runtime ingestion for competing replay/live drain ownership and delete only an
  evidenced duplicate path.
- `PRUNE-04` — immediate journal draining and recovery polling remain separate because they have
  different latency/recovery duties. The actual duplicate in runtime ingestion was the synthetic
  `turn.started` construction and buffered-message flush repeated by Codex steer and ordinary request
  matching; both now share one tail without a new helper. Net runtime change: **-14 LOC**. Focused
  streaming, same-thread ordering, and Codex steer gates pass 3/3. Next: inspect `ProjectionPipeline`
  for repeated projection application ownership.
- `PRUNE-05` — `ProjectionPipeline.projectEvent` no longer implements a third copy of hot/deferred
  projector selection and environment provisioning. It composes the existing `projectHotEvent` and
  `projectDeferredEvent` paths while retaining their separate transactions, then advances snapshot
  cursors. Net runtime change: **-13 LOC**. Focused rollback, attachment-side-effect, and destructive
  history gates pass 3/3. Next: inspect `ProviderService` for overlapping session/provider ownership.
- `PRUNE-06` — approval and structured user-input responses no longer own parallel copies of route
  resolution, active-runtime validation, lifecycle-generation fencing, and lifecycle lock scope in
  `ProviderService`. One in-file interaction path owns those invariants; adapter payloads and approval
  analytics remain variant-specific. Net runtime-path change: **-26 LOC**. Focused Claude, Gemini,
  ACP/Droid, and Pi interaction-generation gates pass 4/4. Next: inspect `wsRpc` for duplicated RPC
  admission/dispatch ownership.
- `PRUNE-07` — fourteen Git mutation RPC handlers no longer each own a copy of the same best-effort
  status-refresh tail. One in-file wrapper preserves the original cause-swallowing refresh policy
  while each Git operation and RPC error remains unchanged. Net runtime change: **-4 LOC**. Existing
  wsRpc authentication/negotiation integration gates pass 6/6; the repo has no focused Git-handler RPC
  test, and no scaffold was added. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-90 LOC**. Next: document the
  official ACP SDK canary boundary and exact custom-wire deletion map without changing runtime code.
- `PRUNE-08` — ACP boundary documentation is now exact. The seam is the existing
  `AcpSessionRuntime` wire-construction point; Grok is a static no-fallback canary; provider adapters
  keep the existing runtime shape; and the final cutover deletes the complete `packages/effect-acp`
  package (about 13,123 non-test source/generator LOC), production imports, legacy conformance block,
  dependency, and lock entry. No runtime ACP code changed. Next: continue net-negative deletion in an
  evidenced hotspot; do not begin the canary during this checkpoint.
- `PRUNE-09` — `ProviderService` no longer reads `SYNARA_PROVIDER_RUNTIME_IDLE_STOP_MS` twice through
  a nullish fallback to the exact same expression. Net runtime change: **-2 LOC**. Direct inspection
  and `git diff --check` prove value equivalence; no test scaffold was added. Cumulative pruning runtime
  change: **-92 LOC**. Next: continue with an evidenced duplicate inside an existing hotspot.
- `PRUNE-10` — eight pinned-message and thread-marker projector cases no longer repeat the same
  repository load, missing-row exit, and upsert protocol. One in-file `updateThreadProjection` owner
  preserves separate payload transforms while deleting the repeated persistence shell. Net runtime
  change: **-60 LOC**. Focused pinned-message/marker round-trip gates pass 2/2. Cumulative pruning
  runtime change: **-152 LOC**. Next: reuse the proven owner only for remaining simple thread-row
  mutations; keep async turn-start/meta logic separate.
- `PRUNE-11` — runtime-mode, interaction-mode, soft-delete, archive, and unarchive projection cases
  now reuse the same existing-row update owner. Attachment cleanup still registers before soft-delete;
  async metadata, turn-start, and deferred-summary paths remain independent. Net runtime change:
  **-38 LOC**. Focused runtime-mode and thread-delete cleanup gates pass 2/2. Cumulative pruning runtime
  change: **-190 LOC**. Next: inspect another hotspot for a similarly exact repeated ownership shell.
- `PRUNE-12` — `ProviderService.runStopAll` no longer persists active sessions once through the live
  session path and again through the persisted-thread path. One stopped-binding owner now writes the
  union of persisted and active thread ids once, retaining the richer live-session payload when
  available. Net runtime change: **-2 LOC**. The focused stopped-binding/adapter-cleanup gate passes
  1/1. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-192 LOC**. Next: continue only where another existing
  hotspot path can be deleted or merged without adding an abstraction.
- `PRUNE-13` — approval and structured user-input handlers no longer repeat the null-command guard
  already owned by `claimInteractionResponse`; a non-null provider thread id proves that guard passed.
  Net runtime change: **-2 LOC**. Both focused interaction-forwarding gates pass 2/2. Cumulative
  pruning runtime change: **-194 LOC**. Next: continue deletion-only inspection of the same hotspots.
- `PRUNE-14` — the three turn-dispatch methods no longer maintain an `adapterReturned` flag that was
  captured as `false` when their finalizer was constructed and therefore could never affect cleanup.
  `finishTurnDispatch` now expresses that actual retained-result condition directly. Net runtime
  change: **-7 LOC**. Focused newer-owner and older-success-promotion gates pass 2/2. Cumulative
  pruning runtime change: **-201 LOC**. Next: inspect exact duplicate payload/projection ownership;
  do not generalize the dispatch API during this checkpoint.
- `PRUNE-15` — `ProviderRuntimeIngestion` now owns one activity-row constructor for item started,
  updated, and completed tool lifecycle events; the existing update/completion context-compaction
  variants remain in the same branch. Net runtime change: **-55 LOC**. Focused compaction progress and
  terminal gates pass 2/2. Two broader tool-lifecycle harness cases time out before reaching the
  mapper and remain deferred evidence; no scaffold was added. Cumulative pruning runtime change:
  **-256 LOC**. Next: continue only with mechanically provable deletion in an existing hotspot.
- `PRUNE-16` — activity-history projection for revert and conversation rollback now shares one
  load/empty/delete/reinsert path while retaining separate row-selection rules. Net runtime change:
  **-18 LOC**. Existing destructive-history integration gates pass 3/3; no activity-only fixture was
  added. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-274 LOC**. Next: inspect the adjacent message/plan
  history branches for the same exact replacement ownership without introducing a generic layer.
- `PRUNE-17` — proposed-plan history projection now shares one repository replacement path for revert
  and conversation rollback while retaining the existing turn-count and removed-turn-id selectors.
  Net runtime change: **-20 LOC**. Direct branch inspection and `git diff --check` are the available
  evidence; the repository has no focused proposed-plan destructive-history fixture, and none was
  added. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-294 LOC**. Next: inspect another exact duplicate owner;
  keep message history separate unless attachment side effects can remain explicit.
- `PRUNE-18` — message-history projection now shares one delete/reinsert and retained-attachment path
  for revert and conversation rollback. Rollback's zero-turn exit and attachment-prune suppression,
  plus revert's turn-count selection, remain explicit. Net runtime change: **-11 LOC**. Focused revert,
  rollback, and managed/legacy attachment gates pass 3/3. Cumulative pruning runtime change:
  **-305 LOC**. Next: inspect exact turn-history replacement ownership or stop if event semantics do
  not permit a direct merge.
- `PRUNE-19` — turn-history projection now shares one load/delete/reinsert path for revert and
  conversation rollback. Revert still rebuilds unconditionally from checkpoint counts; rollback still
  exits on no change and restores valid pending turn starts. Net runtime change: **-15 LOC**. Existing
  destructive-history gates pass 3/3; no pending-turn rollback fixture exists, and none was added.
  Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-320 LOC**. Next: leave projection history consolidated and
  inspect another named hotspot for exact duplicate control flow.
- `PRUNE-20` — shell and thread cursor-safe RPC streams now reuse one orchestration high-water Effect
  and identical RPC error mapping; their snapshots, filters, and replay errors remain separate. Net
  runtime change: **-3 LOC**. Direct value/error equivalence and `git diff --check` are sufficient;
  no focused stream-constructor fixture exists. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-323 LOC**.
  Next: inspect another exact duplicate in a named hotspot without generalizing RPC stream assembly.
- `PRUNE-21` — the two assistant-delivery `Ref.modify` callbacks now construct their cloned three-map
  next state once instead of rebuilding the identical envelope at five return sites. Matching, debt,
  and cache logic are unchanged. Net runtime change: **-25 LOC**. Focused same-thread ordering, Codex
  steer, and settled-unmatched-debt gates pass 3/3. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-348 LOC**.
  Next: inspect another mechanically identical state/payload shell in a named hotspot.
- `PRUNE-22` — canonical request opened/resolved events now share one approval activity constructor;
  requested summary/detail and resolved summary/decision remain explicit variants. Net runtime change:
  **-19 LOC**. The focused canonical request lifecycle gate passes 1/1. Cumulative pruning runtime
  change: **-367 LOC**. Next: continue with an exact duplicated payload/control-flow shell only.
- `PRUNE-23` — first-turn branch and title rename fibers now share one message/model/provider input
  object; branch/worktree fields remain branch-only and both workflows remain separate. Net runtime
  change: **-4 LOC**. Focused title and temporary-worktree branch rename gates pass 2/2. Cumulative
  pruning runtime change: **-371 LOC**. Next: continue only with literal repeated ownership in a named
  hotspot.
- `PRUNE-24` — deferred non-streaming user-message shell timestamps now reuse the existing
  `updateThreadProjection` load/missing/upsert owner; the timestamp transform remains local and
  effectful summary rebuilds remain separate. Net runtime change: **-10 LOC**. Direct equivalence and
  `git diff --check` are the available evidence; the existing timestamp fixture covers only the
  unchanged streaming-assistant exit. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-381 LOC**. Next: inspect
  another synchronous thread-row mutation or move to a different hotspot.
- `PRUNE-25` — synchronous thread metadata patches now reuse `updateThreadProjection`; sparse field
  updates and branch-change reset semantics remain inside the callback. Net runtime change: **-6
  LOC**. Direct branch equivalence and `git diff --check` are the available evidence; no focused
  metadata projection fixture exists. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-387 LOC**. Next: leave
  effectful thread summary/turn-start paths separate and inspect another hotspot.
- `PRUNE-26` — zero-turn and provider-backed conversation rollback now converge on one completion
  command; provider interruption/rollback remains conditional on a positive turn count. Net runtime
  change: **-14 LOC**. Focused provider rollback and active-turn interruption gates pass 2/2; the
  zero-turn path has direct control-flow equivalence but no dedicated fixture. Cumulative pruning
  runtime change: **-401 LOC**. Next: continue only with a literal duplicate owner.
- `PRUNE-27` — three attachment ownership checks no longer retain a parsed thread-segment alias or a
  redundant falsy clause before the same string comparison. Net runtime change: **-3 LOC**. Direct
  comparison equivalence and `git diff --check` are sufficient; cleanup policies remain separate.
  Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-404 LOC**. Next: inspect another dead alias/duplicate branch in
  the named hotspots.
- `PRUNE-28` — pending-interaction requested, resolved, and response-failure activities now compute
  branch-specific rows and share one repository upsert/shell-count tail. Lifecycle, response-command,
  and settlement guards remain local. Net runtime change: **-16 LOC**. Focused approval and user-input
  projection gates pass 2/2. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-420 LOC**. Next: inspect another
  duplicate persistence tail in a named hotspot.
- `PRUNE-29` — structured user-input requested/resolved events now share one activity constructor;
  questions and answers remain explicit payload variants. Net runtime change: **-18 LOC**. The focused
  request-and-resolution projection gate passes 1/1. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-438 LOC**.
  Next: continue only where another event pair has the same row owner and simple payload variants.
- `PRUNE-30` — provider turn dispatch now reuses the first-turn message/model/provider payload already
  built for title/branch work; skills, mentions, runtime, review, and dispatch fields remain local.
  Net runtime change: **-9 LOC**. The focused normal turn-start/session/send gate passes 1/1.
  Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-447 LOC**. Next: inspect another local payload rebuilt within
  one execution path.
- `PRUNE-31` — provider start/restart and native fork alternatives now share one local thread/cwd/model/
  provider-options/runtime configuration; provider/resume and source-thread fields remain path-local.
  Net runtime change: **-3 LOC**. The focused normal start gate passes 1/1. The native Droid fork case
  is quarantined before session resolution and times out, so fork evidence remains deferred; no
  scaffold was added. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-450 LOC**. Next: continue only with direct
  payload or control-flow convergence.
- `PRUNE-32` — the local provider-session starter no longer accepts an unused optional provider field
  or wrapper object; its only live argument is the optional resume cursor. Net runtime change: **-5
  LOC**. Focused fresh-start and idle-session-restart gates pass 2/2. A broader runtime-mode scenario
  completes its restart calls but later misses an unrelated durable event assertion and remains
  deferred. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-455 LOC**. Next: inspect dead local API fields and
  unreachable guards only.
- `PRUNE-33` — three one-use ProviderService `bindingOption` aliases now feed directory reads directly
  into `Option.getOrUndefined`; the persisted-binding iterator remains separate. Net runtime change:
  **-3 LOC**. Direct expression equivalence and `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative pruning
  runtime change: **-458 LOC**. Next: continue dead-alias inspection in named hotspots only.
- `PRUNE-34` — the keyed binding-lock constructor now returns its only consumed `withLock` function
  directly; its never-called `clear` compatibility surface and wrapper alias are deleted. Net runtime
  change: **-1 LOC**. Direct call-graph evidence and `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative
  pruning runtime change: **-459 LOC**. Next: inspect dormant local APIs and one-use aliases only.
- `PRUNE-35` — ProviderService no longer names the one-use requested-session boolean before its guard;
  the active-session lookup alias remains because it carries meaning. Net runtime change: **-1 LOC**.
  Direct guard equivalence and `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative pruning runtime change:
  **-460 LOC**. Next: continue only with dead local API or control-flow deletion.
- `PRUNE-36` — runtime turn-state, turn-error, and runtime-error readers no longer assign parsed
  payload values only to return them immediately. Net runtime change: **-3 LOC**. Direct expression
  equivalence and `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-463 LOC**.
  Next: continue one-use parsing/control-flow deletion in named hotspots.
- `PRUNE-37` — `resolveRoutableSession` no longer copies the caller's validated thread id into every
  result branch. Adapter calls and compact/rollback persistence use the existing input identity; route
  recovery, provider selection, active state, and lifecycle generation remain unchanged. Net runtime
  change: **-4 LOC**. Direct call-graph inspection and `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative
  pruning runtime change: **-467 LOC**. Next: continue only with dead result fields or duplicated
  control-flow ownership in the named hotspots.
- `PRUNE-38` — the expected provider-turn reader no longer stores the full session list and its single
  matching session only to return `activeTurnId`; it returns the unchanged lookup directly. Net runtime
  change: **-1 LOC**. Direct expression equivalence and `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative
  pruning runtime change: **-468 LOC**. Next: stop micro-pruning when aliases carry domain meaning;
  continue only with dead result fields or literal duplicate ownership in the named hotspots.
- `PRUNE-39` — revert activity and proposed-plan retention no longer compute the same
  checkpoint-bounded turn-id set independently. One local selector owns that calculation while the
  row filters and repository paths remain separate. Net runtime change: **-2 LOC**. Direct expression
  equivalence and `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-470 LOC**.
  Next: continue only with another literal duplicated owner in the named hotspots.
- `PRUNE-40` — revert message retention no longer owns separate copies of the same fallback
  count/filter/slice/add branch for user and assistant roles. One ordered role loop preserves the user-
  then-assistant sequence and all retained-id and turn-id rules. Net runtime change: **-16 LOC**.
  Direct control-flow equivalence and `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative pruning runtime
  change: **-486 LOC**. Next: inspect another literal duplicate in a named hotspot; do not generalize
  distinct recovery or provider-dispatch envelopes.
- `PRUNE-41` — queued-send and steer dispatch no longer rebuild the same thread, attachment, skill,
  mention, model, and interaction payload. One local input owns those fields while message text,
  retries, and the distinct provider methods remain path-local. Net runtime change: **-2 LOC**. Direct
  object-shape equivalence and `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative pruning runtime change:
  **-488 LOC**. Next: continue literal duplicate deletion without merging distinct retry/lifecycle
  envelopes.
- `PRUNE-42` — thread-title generation debug and failure logs no longer rebuild the same provider and
  model diagnostic fields. One local context owns the common fields while provider-option presence and
  failure reason remain record-specific. Net runtime change: **-5 LOC**. Direct object-shape
  equivalence and `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-493 LOC**.
  Next: continue only with another literal duplicate owner in a named hotspot.
- `PRUNE-43` — branch/title generation no longer tests for an impossible raw `model` property or
  defensively probes the resolver's required `modelSelection`. Both paths now consume the existing
  typed `TextGenerationProviderInput` directly while retaining optional provider options. Net runtime
  change: **-15 LOC**. Focused first-turn title and temporary-worktree branch rename gates pass 2/2.
  Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-508 LOC**. Next: inspect dormant compatibility shape checks or
  literal duplicate ownership only.
- `PRUNE-44` — provider recovery no longer returns a session field its only caller ignores. Session
  validation, persistence, and analytics remain inside the lifecycle-locked helper, which now returns
  only the adapter consumed by routing. Net runtime change: **-1 LOC**. Direct call-graph inspection
  and `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-509 LOC**. Next:
  continue dead result-surface or literal duplicate deletion in the named hotspots.
- `PRUNE-45` — request-first matching, turn-first matching, and thread cleanup no longer clone the
  same three assistant-delivery binding maps independently. One local clone owner supplies mutable
  copies while each path retains its matching, debt, cache, and deletion rules. Net runtime change:
  **-9 LOC**. Focused same-thread ordering, Codex steer, and completed-unmatched-turn gates pass 3/3.
  Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-518 LOC**. Next: continue only with another literal duplicate
  owner or dead result surface in the named hotspots.

  invokes the existing `runProjectorsForEvent` owner directly with the same one-element array. Net
  runtime change: **-3 LOC**. Direct call-graph inspection and `git diff --check` are sufficient.
  Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-521 LOC**. Next: continue dead wrapper/result-surface deletion
  without merging distinct hot/deferred projection policies.
- `PRUNE-47` — hot, deferred, and bootstrap projection callers no longer provide the same filesystem,
  path, and server-config services independently. The existing projector execution owner now supplies
  those dependencies while selection, cursors, ordering, and SQL error labels remain path-specific.
  Net runtime change: **-5 LOC**. Focused bootstrap and live projection gates pass 2/2. Cumulative
  pruning runtime change: **-526 LOC**. Next: continue duplicate ownership deletion without merging
  distinct hot/deferred policies.
- `PRUNE-48` — hot, deferred, and bootstrap projection effects no longer apply no-op `Effect.asVoid`
  adapters after already returning `void`. `projectEvent` keeps its adapter because snapshot cursor
  advancement can return transaction output. Net runtime change: **-3 LOC**. Direct effect-result
  inspection and `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-529 LOC**.
  Next: continue dead wrapper/result-surface deletion in named hotspots.
- `PRUNE-49` — project metadata selection no longer filters a singleton projector, checks the result
  length, and reconstructs that same singleton. It returns the existing filter result directly. Net
  runtime change: **-4 LOC**. The focused project metadata update gate passes 1/1. Cumulative pruning
  runtime change: **-533 LOC**. Next: continue only with literal duplicate or redundant control-flow
  deletion in named hotspots.
- `PRUNE-50` — project metadata apply and snapshot-state advance callers no longer normalize effects
  whose declared contracts already return `void`. Net runtime change: **-1 LOC**. Direct contract
  inspection and `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-534 LOC**.
  Next: continue dead wrapper/result-surface deletion in named hotspots.

  propagation remain unchanged. Net runtime change: **-7 LOC**. Direct contract inspection and
  `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-541 LOC**. Next: continue
  no-op wrapper or duplicated owner deletion in named hotspots.
- `PRUNE-52` — seven directly yielded runtime-ingestion cleanup/finalization loops no longer normalize
  ignored arrays or restate Effect's sequential default. Returned reasoning-settlement effects keep
  their result shaping; cleanup order and failure propagation remain unchanged. Net runtime change:
  **-8 LOC**. Direct contract inspection and `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative pruning
  runtime change: **-549 LOC**. Next: continue no-op result adapter deletion without changing returned
  effect contracts.

  default. Invalidation/enqueue order and the replay drain fence remain unchanged. Net runtime change:
  **-2 LOC**. Direct contract inspection and `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative pruning
  runtime change: **-551 LOC**. Next: continue redundant default/result adapter deletion in named
  hotspots.

  advancement, and bootstrap loops no longer restate Effect's sequential default. Loop boundaries,
  ordering, and returned results remain unchanged. Net runtime change: **-12 LOC**. Direct contract
  inspection and `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-563 LOC**.
  Next: continue deletion of redundant defaults and result adapters in the named hotspots.

  defaults were already provided by the directly yielded loop. Thread order, live-turn checks, and
  queue draining remain unchanged. Net runtime change: **-1 LOC**. Direct contract inspection and
  `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-564 LOC**. Next: continue
  exact duplicate/default deletion in existing changed hotspot code.
- `PRUNE-56` — reasoning-summary settlement no longer restates Effect's sequential default in its
  nested activity-dispatch and outer summary loops. Both `Effect.asVoid` return contracts remain.
  Net runtime change: **-2 LOC**. Direct contract inspection and `git diff --check` are sufficient.
  Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-566 LOC**. Next: continue exact duplicate/default deletion in
  existing changed hotspot code.
- `PRUNE-57` — the scoped durable-source fork no longer normalizes its handle immediately before a
  bare final `yield*`; the enclosing generator already returns `void`. Fork scope and failure handling
  remain unchanged. Net runtime change: **-1 LOC**. Direct control-flow inspection and
  `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-567 LOC**. Next: continue
  exact no-op result/default deletion in existing changed hotspot code.
- `PRUNE-58` — failed queued-promotion claim release now relies on `Effect.onError` as the sole owner
  of cleanup-result disposal instead of normalizing the repository's boolean first. Release timing,
  failure triggering, and the original effect result remain unchanged. Net runtime change: **-2 LOC**.
  Direct contract inspection and `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative pruning runtime
  change: **-569 LOC**. Next: continue exact no-op result/default deletion in changed hotspot code.
- `PRUNE-59` — title generation no longer creates a provider-options alias used only for a debug

  **-575 LOC**. Next: continue duplicated-owner deletion in existing changed hotspot code.
- `PRUNE-61` — delayed turn-start persistence now tests the repository's `Option` directly instead of
  converting it to a one-use binding alias solely for presence. Newer-binding preservation and stopped
  fallback behavior remain unchanged. Net runtime change: **-3 LOC**. The focused overlapping
  older-turn completion gate passes 1/1. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-578 LOC**. Next:
  continue one-use conversion/alias deletion in existing changed hotspot code.

  directly instead of storing a one-use activity alias. Provider selection, replacement startup, and
  active previous-provider teardown remain unchanged. Net runtime change: **-1 LOC**. Direct
  expression equivalence and `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative pruning runtime change:
  **-579 LOC**. Next: continue exact one-use alias or duplicated-owner deletion in changed hotspots.

  bootstrap-origin behavior is directly equivalent and has no focused fixture. Cumulative pruning
  runtime change: **-584 LOC**. Next: continue duplicated route/persistence ownership deletion in
  existing changed hotspot code.
- `PRUNE-66` — pending delivery modes and unmatched provider turns now share one per-thread FIFO pop
  owner instead of duplicating first-item and delete-last/slice-rest mutation. Request debt, unmatched
  settlement, defaults, and cache binding remain local. Net runtime change: **-1 LOC**. Focused
  same-thread ordering, Codex steer, and settled unmatched-turn gates pass 3/3. Cumulative pruning
  runtime change: **-585 LOC**. Next: continue duplicated state-mutation ownership deletion in changed
  hotspot code.
- `PRUNE-67` — stop-all now builds its thread-indexed active-session map directly from adapter session

  precedes adapter cleanup, analytics, and flush. Net runtime change: **-3 LOC**. The focused active
  session persistence-before-cleanup gate passes 1/1. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-588 LOC**.
  Next: continue intermediate collection or duplicated-owner deletion in changed hotspots.

  1/1. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-593 LOC**. Next: continue exact intermediate collection
  or duplicated-owner deletion in changed hotspots.

  than storing a one-use per-adapter collection. Persisted-binding enrichment is unchanged. Net runtime
  change: **-1 LOC**. Direct expression equivalence and `git diff --check` are sufficient. Cumulative
  pruning runtime change: **-594 LOC**. Next: continue exact intermediate collection or duplicated
  owner deletion in changed hotspots.
- `PRUNE-71` — ProviderService session listing now uses Effect's existing `Array.getSomes` to build

  mapping is directly evident and has no focused fixture. Cumulative pruning runtime change:
  **-608 LOC**. Next: continue duplicate terminal/cursor tail deletion in changed hotspot code.
- `PRUNE-79` — claimed and unclaimed provider-intent processors now delegate quarantine admission to
  the existing skip owner instead of duplicating side-effect classification and blocker checks. Direct

  instead of defining identical closures. Event payloads and assertions are unchanged. Net test-source
  change: **-3 LOC**. Focused attachment-prune and turn-conflict projection gates pass 2/2;
  `git diff --check` passes. Cumulative pruning runtime change remains **-945 LOC**. Next: continue
  only net-negative focused-test fixture consolidation; ACP implementation remains frozen.
- `PRUNE-156` — attachment pruning now lives directly in its sole side-effect loop, deleting the
  remaining single-use prune function while preserving shared entry resolution, file validation,
  retention, and forced removal. Net runtime change: **-8 LOC**. The focused legacy/managed prune gate
  passes 1/1; `git diff --check` passes. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-953 LOC**. Next:
  continue only mechanically exact consolidation in a changed hotspot; ACP implementation remains
  frozen at its documented official-SDK canary and deletion boundary.
- `PRUNE-157` — seven ProviderService idle-cleanup tests now share one typed fake-session cursor
  omission helper instead of repeating the same callback. Timers, events, adapter calls, and
  assertions are unchanged. Net test-source change: **-17 LOC**. Focused persisted-cursor and failed-
  dispatch idle-restoration gates pass 2/2; `git diff --check` passes. Cumulative pruning runtime
  change remains **-953 LOC**. Next: continue only net-negative focused-test fixture consolidation;
  ACP implementation remains frozen.
- `PRUNE-158` — conversation rollback now calls the shared tail-turn collector directly, deleting its
  single-use type-only adapter while preserving the same messages and boundary message ID. Net runtime
  change: **-1 LOC**. Direct call equivalence and `git diff --check` are sufficient; no focused fixture
  was added. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-954 LOC**. Next: continue only mechanically exact
  consolidation in a changed hotspot; ACP implementation remains frozen at its documented official-
  SDK canary and deletion boundary.
- `PRUNE-159` — six ProviderService assertions now share one permissive runtime-payload record
  coercion instead of repeating the same object check and cast. Array acceptance and assertions are
  unchanged. Net test-source change: **-13 LOC**. Focused overlapping-dispatch and runtime-ready
  settlement gates pass 2/2; `git diff --check` passes. Cumulative pruning runtime change remains
  **-954 LOC**. Next: continue only net-negative focused-test fixture consolidation; ACP implementation
  remains frozen.
- `PRUNE-160` — the preserve-queued-turns edit/resend branch now calls the durable promotion
  repository directly, deleting its single-use cancellation wrapper while preserving the same
  thread/message key and wall-clock timestamp. Net runtime change: **-2 LOC**. Direct call equivalence
  and `git diff --check` are sufficient; no focused fixture was added. Cumulative pruning runtime
  change: **-956 LOC**. Next: continue only mechanically exact consolidation in a changed hotspot;
  ACP implementation remains frozen at its documented official-SDK canary and deletion boundary.
- `PRUNE-161` — ProviderCommandReactor's test harness no longer returns the same `reactor` property
  twice consecutively. The duplicate overwrote the identical value, so the harness API is unchanged.
  Net test-source change: **-1 LOC**. Direct object-literal equivalence and `git diff --check` are
  sufficient; no focused fixture was added. Cumulative pruning runtime change remains **-956 LOC**.
  Next: continue only net-negative focused-test fixture consolidation; ACP implementation remains frozen.
- `PRUNE-162` — mirrored stale approval and user-input failure tests now share one typed harness thread
  reader instead of repeating poll-time and assertion-time read-model lookups. Predicates and assertions
  are unchanged. Net test-source change: **-5 LOC**. Both focused interaction-failure gates pass 2/2;
  `git diff --check` passes. Cumulative pruning runtime change remains **-956 LOC**. Next: continue
  only net-negative focused-test fixture consolidation; ACP implementation remains frozen.
- `PRUNE-163` — activity and proposed-plan projection retention now share one turn-scoped row owner
  for revert and one for conversation rollback, deleting four duplicated typed functions while
  preserving their exact predicates. Message and turn retention remain separate. Net runtime change:
  **-20 LOC**. Focused revert and conversation-rollback projection gates pass 2/2; `git diff --check`
  passes. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-976 LOC**. Next: continue only mechanically exact
  consolidation in a changed hotspot; ACP implementation remains frozen at its documented official-
  SDK canary and deletion boundary.
- `PRUNE-164` — first-turn title and worktree-branch rename tests now reuse the typed harness thread
  reader instead of repeating read-model scans. Wait predicates and assertions are unchanged. Net
  test-source change: **-28 LOC**. Focused generated-title and fallback-branch gates pass 2/2;
  `git diff --check` passes. Cumulative pruning runtime change remains **-976 LOC**. Next: continue
  only net-negative focused-test fixture consolidation; ACP implementation remains frozen.
- `PRUNE-165` — runtime-mode/provider recovery tests now reuse the typed harness thread reader,
  deleting repeated thread scans. A misplaced uncertain-delivery assertion now lives in the failed-
  restart test that emits its command instead of the successful-restart test. Net test-source change:
  **-14 LOC**. Focused successful- and failed-restart gates pass 2/2; `git diff --check` passes.
  Cumulative pruning runtime change remains **-976 LOC**. Next: continue only net-negative focused-
  test fixture consolidation; ACP implementation remains frozen.
- `PRUNE-166` — lifecycle generation and response command ID now share one non-empty payload-string
  extractor, deleting two duplicated guards while retaining response-ID branding at its consumer.
  Request-ID and settlement rules remain separate. Net runtime change: **-5 LOC**. Focused reused-
  generation and failed-response correlation gates pass 2/2; `git diff --check` passes. Cumulative
  pruning runtime change: **-981 LOC**. Next: continue only mechanically exact consolidation in a
  changed hotspot; ACP implementation remains frozen at its documented official-SDK canary and
  deletion boundary.
- `PRUNE-167` — three Droid fork/sidechat recovery tests now reuse the typed harness reader for their
  custom thread IDs. Net test-source change: **-9 LOC**. Direct lookup equivalence and `git diff
--check` pass; two focused gates timed out because the reactor skipped each target thread as already
  quarantined before the unchanged predicate could succeed. Cumulative pruning runtime change remains
  **-981 LOC**. Next: continue only net-negative focused-test fixture consolidation; ACP implementation
  remains frozen.
- `PRUNE-168` — conversation-rollback turn retention now reuses the shared turn-scoped row owner,
  deleting its type-specific helper while preserving the empty-set fast path and exact removal
  predicate. Activities and proposed plans remain on that same owner; message rollback stays separate.
  Net runtime change: **-8 LOC**. The focused conversation-rollback projection gate passes 1/1;
  `git diff --check` passes. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-989 LOC**. Next: continue only
  mechanically exact consolidation in a changed hotspot; ACP implementation remains frozen at its
  documented official-SDK canary and deletion boundary.
- `PRUNE-169` — final dense turn-start/edit-failure tests now reuse the typed harness thread reader
  instead of polling `threads[0]` and rescanning for `thread-1`. Status predicates and assertions are
  unchanged. Net test-source change: **-17 LOC**. Focused edit-start failure and observable-starting-
  session gates pass 2/2; `git diff --check` passes. Cumulative pruning runtime change remains
  **-989 LOC**. Next: close focused-test fixture pruning and retain the documented ACP boundary;
  ACP implementation remains frozen.
- `PRUNE-170` — message retention, turn-scoped activity/plan retention, and the turn projector now
  share one checkpoint-eligible revert-turn owner, deleting three predicate copies and the single-use
  retained-turn-ID wrapper. Net runtime change: **-10 LOC**. The focused removed-turn message-
  retention gate passes 1/1; `git diff --check` passes. Cumulative pruning runtime change:
  **-999 LOC**. Next: continue only mechanically exact consolidation in a changed hotspot; ACP
  implementation remains frozen at its documented official-SDK canary and deletion boundary.
- `PRUNE-171` — the bounded pruning checkpoint is closed. The five named provider/orchestration
  hotspots now have one fewer layer of duplicated ownership, with a cumulative runtime reduction of
  **999 LOC**. Nine focused-test fixture phases also removed **107 test-source LOC** without changing
  their predicates or assertions. The official ACP SDK seam, static Grok canary, no-fallback rule,
  parity gate, and full `effect-acp` deletion ledger remain defined but unimplemented. `git diff
--check` passes; heavyweight workspace checks remain deferred by instruction. Two focused Droid
  gates retain their recorded pre-predicate quarantine timeouts. Next: no implementation work until
  an unopened roadmap row or ACP cutover is explicitly unfrozen.
- `PRUNE-172` — `sendTurn`, `steerTurn`, and `startReview` now share one ProviderService dispatch-
  generation lifecycle owner, deleting three repeated idle-sensitive/suspend/begin/finish shells while
  preserving their method-specific routing, persistence, and analytics. Net runtime change: **-5 LOC**.
  Focused send persistence and overlapping steer/review generation gates pass 2/2; `git diff --check`
  passes. Cumulative pruning runtime change: **-1004 LOC**. The user then explicitly unfroze every
  remaining consolidated roadmap row for sequential implementation followed by one sweep.
- `PRUNE-173` — the residual `effect-acp` compatibility layer is deleted. Shared runtime/model code,
  Grok, Droid, Cursor, and focused tests use official SDK types directly; local `AcpErrors.ts` and
  `AcpExtensions.ts` retain only Effect-native runtime errors and non-standard extension codecs. The
  generated schema, workspace package, server dependency, release manifest entry, historical
  benchmark engine, and lockfile entries are gone. Focused ACP/provider gates pass **168/168** with
  3 environment-dependent tests skipped; official conformance passes **10/10**, the server build and
  official-only benchmark smoke pass, and zero-import plus `git diff --check` searches pass.
  Heavyweight workspace verification remains deferred by instruction.

## Per-workstream loop

1. Set the row to `IN PROGRESS` and update **Current pointer**.
2. Read the exact finding in `audit/README.md`; do not load unrelated findings.
3. Inspect cited symbols, callers, existing tests for behavior, and the current diff.
4. State a small in-scope/out-of-scope boundary.
5. Implement one coherent phase, adapting to existing changes rather than replacing them.
6. Inspect the diff for scope leakage and duplicated old/new authority.
7. Run only a necessary small check, or record verification as deferred.
8. Update the finding in `audit/README.md` with implementation status and concise evidence.
9. Update this table and pointer.
10. Report files changed, behavior, duplication removed, checks run/deferred, risks, and next
    eligible item.

## ACP completion rule

`P2-ACP-01` is code-complete at the approved wire seam inside `AcpSessionRuntime`; no provider-level
SDK facade exists. Grok, Droid, and Cursor all fail through the official SDK path—an operation is
never retried through `effect-acp`. The official SDK owns validation, JSON-RPC correlation and
cancellation, handler dispatch, and NDJSON encoding. Synara retains Effect lifecycle, bounded
admission, process teardown, product/session policy, normalized events, three local Effect-native
errors, and minimal non-standard extension codecs. No `effect-acp` package or import remains.

## Completion rule

The roadmap is code-complete when every row is `DONE`, `CODE COMPLETE`, or explicitly
`REJECTED`/`BLOCKED` with evidence; duplicate authorities and dormant competing scaffolds have
been removed or safely activated; and both this controller and `audit/README.md` agree.

It is not release-verified until the user separately authorizes the repository-required full
verification pass.
