# Release Checklist

This document covers build-only native validation and publishing desktop releases from one tag.

## What the workflow does

- Triggers:
  - Manual dispatch defaults to build-only validation and uploads workflow artifacts without publishing anything.
  - A pushed tag matching `v*.*.*` publishes after successful builds.
  - Manual publication requires the explicit `publish_release=true` input.
- Runs quality gates first: lint, typecheck, test.
- Builds four artifacts in parallel:
  - macOS `arm64` DMG
  - macOS `x64` DMG
  - Linux `x64` AppImage
  - Windows `x64` NSIS installer
- Publishes one versioned GitHub Release with all produced files.
  - Versions with a suffix after `X.Y.Z` (for example `1.2.3-alpha.1`) are published as GitHub prereleases.
  - The compatibility release remains GitHub Latest permanently; later clean Synara releases never replace it.
- Publishes default-channel compatibility metadata plus byte-identical, same-version `synara*.yml` placeholders, then advances the dedicated channel after migration.
- Mirrors stable versioned desktop payloads and dedicated `synara*.yml` metadata onto the pinned compatibility release.
- Publishes prerelease installers only on their versioned GitHub prerelease; prereleases never replace the stable `synara` update manifests.
- Publishes the CLI package (`apps/server`, npm package `@synara/cli`) with OIDC trusted publishing.
- Signing is optional and auto-detected per platform from secrets.

## Desktop auto-update notes

- Runtime updater: `electron-updater` in `apps/desktop/src/main.ts`.
- Update UX:
  - Background checks run on startup delay + interval.
  - New updates are prepared/downloaded in the background after detection; install/restart stays manual.
  - The desktop UI shows a rocket update button while preparing and switches to an install action once the update is ready.
- Provider: GitHub Releases (`provider: github`) configured at build time.
- Repository visibility: public. The authenticated private-repository provider does not honor custom channel filenames.
- Runtime channel: `synara`. The default `latest` channel is reserved for the permanent compatibility hop.
- Repository slug source:
  - `SYNARA_DESKTOP_UPDATE_REPOSITORY` (format `owner/repo`), if set.
  - otherwise `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` from GitHub Actions.
- Required Synara release assets for updater:
  - platform installers (`.exe`, `.dmg`, `.AppImage`, plus macOS `.zip` for Squirrel.Mac update payloads)
  - `synara-mac.yml`, `synara.yml`, and `synara-linux.yml` metadata
  - the compatibility release also retains `latest-mac.yml`, `latest.yml`, and `latest-linux.yml`
  - `*.blockmap` files, except the macOS update `.zip.blockmap` removed after zip repack
- Enforced upgrade path:
  - The compatibility version from `scripts/release-update-policy.json` remains GitHub Latest permanently and owns `latest*.yml` plus byte-identical, same-version `synara*.yml` placeholders.
  - Predecessor installations can therefore see only that compatibility version on their default channel.
  - The compatibility build migrates local state and then checks the dedicated `synara` channel, whose placeholders report that the compatibility build is already current.
  - Every clean Synara release is created with `make_latest=false`. Its payloads are uploaded to the pinned compatibility release first, and its three channel manifests are uploaded last.
  - Re-publishing the compatibility release fails closed once its dedicated-channel manifests advertise a newer version, preventing an accidental channel rollback.
  - Clean-release preflight also requires all six compatibility/default and dedicated-channel manifests, and both preflight and publication fail closed if GitHub Latest is not the configured compatibility tag.
- Production desktop builds omit web/server/desktop source maps by default to keep update payloads small. Set `SYNARA_WEB_SOURCEMAP=1`, `SYNARA_SERVER_SOURCEMAP=1`, or `SYNARA_DESKTOP_SOURCEMAP=1` only for a diagnostic release that needs them.
- macOS metadata note:
  - The build initially emits `latest-mac.yml` for both Intel and Apple Silicon.
  - The workflow merges the per-arch macOS metadata, then copies the merged manifest to `synara-mac.yml` for the compatibility release or renames it for a clean release.
  - The desktop build script repacks the macOS update `.zip` with `ditto`, verifies Electron framework symlinks, extracts the zip, validates the extracted app signature, patches the matching `latest-mac*.yml` hash/size, and removes the stale `.zip.blockmap`.
  - macOS updater downloads intentionally use the full zip payload so Squirrel.Mac installs the exact signed archive validated by release build.
- Local smoke test:
  - Run `bun run release:smoke:mac-update -- --skip-build --build-version 0.1.5` on macOS after local desktop/server/web dist files exist.
  - The smoke builds a mock update artifact, validates manifest hash/size, serves a HEAD-only local endpoint, confirms the manifest and zip are addressable without downloading the zip body, then cleans up its temp output.
  - Boolean env flags for release scripts accept `true/false`, `1/0`, `yes/no`, and `on/off`; CLI flags are still preferred for repeatable local commands.

## 0) npm OIDC trusted publishing setup (CLI)

The workflow publishes the CLI with `bun publish` from `apps/server` after bumping
the package version to the release tag version.

Checklist:

1. Confirm the npm account controls the `@synara` scope and can publish `@synara/cli`.
2. In npm package settings, configure Trusted Publisher:
   - Provider: GitHub Actions
   - Repository: this repo
   - Workflow file: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
   - Environment (if used): match your npm trusted publishing config
3. Ensure npm account and org policies allow trusted publishing for the package.
4. Create release tag `vX.Y.Z` and push; workflow will:
   - set `apps/server/package.json` version to `X.Y.Z`
   - build web + server
   - run `bun publish --access public`

## Synara notes

- The desktop updater expects the pinned compatibility release in this repository to include the generated updater metadata files, not just the installers.
- The published release title should read `Synara vX.Y.Z`.
- By default, the first-party desktop release path does not require CLI publish or post-release version-bump automation.
- Optional jobs stay disabled unless repository variables enable them:
  - `SYNARA_PUBLISH_CLI=1`
  - `SYNARA_FINALIZE_RELEASE=1`

## 1) Build-only native CI validation

Use this before publication to validate the real native macOS, Linux, and Windows build matrix. Build-only mode does not create a tag, GitHub Release, npm package, updater manifest, or version-bump commit.

1. Push the release-candidate branch so GitHub Actions can check it out.
2. Start the workflow in build-only mode:
   - `gh workflow run release.yml --ref BRANCH -f version=X.Y.Z -f publish_release=false`
3. Wait for `.github/workflows/release.yml` to finish.
4. Confirm preflight and all four native matrix builds pass.
5. Download the workflow artifacts and sanity-check installation on each OS.

To publish from a manual dispatch instead of a tag push, pass `publish_release=true`. This is intentionally opt-in.

## 2) Apple signing + notarization setup (macOS)

Required secrets used by the workflow:

- `CSC_LINK`
- `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_API_KEY`
- `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`
- `APPLE_API_ISSUER`

Checklist:

1. Apple Developer account access:
   - Team has rights to create Developer ID certificates.
2. Create `Developer ID Application` certificate.
3. Export certificate + private key as `.p12` from Keychain.
4. Base64-encode the `.p12` and store as `CSC_LINK`.
5. Store the `.p12` export password as `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`.
6. In App Store Connect, create an API key (Team key).
7. Add API key values:
   - `APPLE_API_KEY`: contents of the downloaded `.p8`
   - `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`: Key ID
   - `APPLE_API_ISSUER`: Issuer ID
8. Re-run a tag release and confirm macOS artifacts are signed/notarized.

Notes:

- `APPLE_API_KEY` is stored as raw key text in secrets.
- The workflow writes it to a temporary `AuthKey_<id>.p8` file at runtime.

## 3) Azure Trusted Signing setup (Windows)

Windows signing is optional for both the `0.4.2` compatibility bridge and the
clean `0.5.0` release. When any Azure signing secret is absent, the workflow
continues and produces an unsigned NSIS installer, matching previous releases.
Signing is enabled only when all of the following secrets are present:

- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ACCOUNT_NAME`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE_PROFILE_NAME`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_PUBLISHER_NAME`

Optional signing checklist:

1. Create Azure Trusted Signing account and certificate profile.
2. Record ATS values:
   - Endpoint
   - Account name
   - Certificate profile name
   - Publisher name
3. Create/choose an Entra app registration (service principal).
4. Grant service principal permissions required by Trusted Signing.
5. Create a client secret for the service principal.
6. Add Azure secrets listed above in GitHub Actions secrets.
7. Re-run a build-only workflow and confirm the Windows installer is signed.

If Windows signing is not being configured, no placeholder or empty secrets are
needed. Leave them absent and verify the workflow reports that it is building an
unsigned installer.

## 4) Ongoing release checklist

1. Ensure `main` is green in CI.
2. Run the build-only native CI validation for the release-candidate branch and version.
3. Bump app version as needed.
4. Confirm `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/releases/latest --jq .tag_name` returns the compatibility tag configured in `scripts/release-update-policy.json`.
5. Create release tag: `vX.Y.Z`.
6. Push tag.
7. Verify workflow steps:
   - preflight passes
   - all matrix builds pass
   - release job uploads expected files
8. Confirm the new versioned release is not GitHub Latest and the pinned compatibility release contains the new payloads plus all three `synara` manifests.
9. Smoke test downloaded artifacts.

## 5) Troubleshooting

- macOS build unsigned when expected signed:
  - Check all Apple secrets are populated and non-empty.
- Windows build unsigned when expected signed:
  - Check all Azure ATS and auth secrets are populated and non-empty.
- Build fails with signing error:
  - Retry with all Azure signing secrets removed to use the supported unsigned path.
  - Re-check certificate/profile names and tenant/client credentials.
