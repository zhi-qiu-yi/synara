// FILE: whatsNew/entries.ts
// Purpose: Curated "What's new" changelog rendered in the post-update dialog
// and the settings Release history view.
// Layer: static data consumed by `useWhatsNew`, `WhatsNewDialog`, and
// `ChangelogAccordion`.
//
// Authoring guide
// ---------------
//   - Prepend new releases so the file reads newest-first (the UI sorts too,
//     but keeping the source tidy makes PRs easier to review).
//   - `version` must match `apps/web/package.json#version` exactly. The
//     logic compares versions as semver and only opens the dialog when the
//     installed build has a curated entry here.
//   - `date` is rendered verbatim — pick whatever format you want (e.g.
//     `"Apr 18"`, `"2026-04-18"`), just be consistent release-to-release.
//   - Each feature takes an `id` (stable, unique per release), a short
//     `title`, a marketing `description`, and optionally an `image`
//     (absolute path from `apps/web/public`, e.g. `/whats-new/0.0.29/foo.png`)
//     plus `details` for the longer technical note shown under the image.
