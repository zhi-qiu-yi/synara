// FILE: whatsNew/useWhatsNew.ts
// Purpose: React hook that drives the two-stage "What's new" surface:
//   1. A small popout card (bottom-left) advertising the new release.
//   2. A dialog with the release notes, opened only when the user taps the card.
// Persists the "already seen this version" marker in localStorage so the popout
// doesn't reappear after dismissal.
// Layer: hook — glue between `logic.ts` (pure rules), the changelog data, and
// the popout + dialog components.

 *   - First launch → silently record the current version, no popout.
 *   - User already on the latest (or somehow ahead) → no popout.
 *   - User upgraded and there are curated notes → show the popout card.
 *   - User upgraded but no curated notes exist → silently advance the marker.
 *
 * The dialog is never opened automatically — only via the popout card click.
