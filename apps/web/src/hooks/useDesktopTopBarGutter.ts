/**
 * Tailwind padding that clears the macOS traffic light cluster
 * (positioned at x=16, y=16 in the Electron BrowserWindow, see apps/desktop main).
 *
 * The 3-button cluster ends at roughly x=68 (16px inset + ~52px cluster); this
 * gutter places the leading controls ~36px to the right of the lights so they
 * read as a clearly separate group instead of crowding the green button.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — why the `!` (important) modifier:
 * Host headers carry their own horizontal padding (`px-4`, `px-3 sm:px-5`, …).
 * `twMerge` does NOT treat `px-*` and `pl-*` as conflicting in this direction, so
 * BOTH survive a `cn()` call and the winner is left to CSS-cascade order — which
 * differs per header (`px-4` vs `px-3 sm:px-5`), making the leading controls land
 * at a DIFFERENT x when the sidebar is open vs closed. Marking the gutter
 * `!important` makes `padding-left` always beat the non-important base
 * `px-*`, so every surface resolves to the exact same x in both states. Both the
 * base and `sm:` variants are emitted so the override also wins at `sm:` (e.g.
 * over `sm:px-5`).
 *
 * Single source of truth: every top bar AND the open-sidebar header use this so
 * the leading controls sit at the same x whether the sidebar is open or closed.
 * This is the one knob to tune the lights→controls gap. The three macOS dots at
 * `trafficLightPosition.x = 16` span to ~70px, so 84px leaves a tight ~14px gap
 * before the toggle (was 104px / ~34px, which read as too far from the lights).

/**
 * Pure helper: should a top bar at the left edge of the desktop window reserve
 * space for the macOS traffic light buttons?
 *
 * The traffic lights live in the renderer area (titleBarStyle = "hiddenInset"),
 * so any chrome surface that sits flush against the window's left edge needs a
 * gutter, or its leading controls will collide with the close/minimize/zoom
 * buttons. The sidebar always sits on the left and provides that gutter while it
 * is open; when it is collapsed — or on mobile, where the drawer floats over
 * content instead of reserving a column — the next surface to the right has to
 * provide it instead.
