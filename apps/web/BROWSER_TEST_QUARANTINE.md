# Browser test quarantine

The blocking browser suite selects every test whose full name does not contain
`[geometry:linux]`. Adding that marker is therefore a reviewed quarantine
change, not a broad file exclusion. Runtime, event-stream, teardown, and
unhandled errors must never be added here.

Owner for every entry: `web/transcript`.

Removal criterion: remove an entry after the underlying estimator, font, or
layout behavior is corrected and the untagged test passes in three consecutive
blocking Ubuntu CI runs.

The original Linux failure evidence is commit `7c80c0dee`, whose CI run reported
12+ ChatView geometry failures after browser tests first moved to hosted Ubuntu.
The current quarantine is intentionally narrower and contains only assertions
whose result depends directly on pixel/font/layout measurements.

Total quarantined cases: **11**.

Explicitly not quarantined:

- delayed attachment loading must remain bottom-stuck;
- optimistic user sends must smoothly re-stick to the bottom;
- orchestration event replay/deduplication and keybinding config notifications;
- any browser runtime or unhandled error.
