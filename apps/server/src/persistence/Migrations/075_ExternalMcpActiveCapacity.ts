  // Capacity is derived entirely from durable state so admission survives a
  // server restart and does not depend on an in-memory semaphore. A creation
  // saga owns one slot until dispatch fails or compensation becomes terminal.
  // Compensating operations remain claims even when task registration failed,
  // so cleanup can never briefly release capacity before a task row exists.
  // Once a task is planned, missing thread/turn projections are treated as
  // pending: projectors may lag the committed creation result and must never
  // briefly free capacity.
  // Failed task rows also retain capacity while compensation is non-terminal or
  // a projected turn is still live. UNION (rather than UNION ALL) prevents the
  // hand-off between durable operation and task records from consuming two slots.
  // Recreate the view if an unreleased development build installed an older
  // definition before migration 75 was registered.
