// Purpose: correlate authenticated WebSocket upgrades with RPC handler execution.
// Layer: server transport support
//
// RpcServer.toHttpEffectWebsocket forks the RPC server on the layer-build scope,
// so services provided around the per-connection HTTP upgrade effect never reach
// handler fibers. This registry bridges that gap: the upgrade route registers the
// connection's authenticated session under an unguessable key, injects the key as
// a synthetic request header (overriding any client-supplied value), and the RPC
// admission middleware resolves it back into handler-scoped services.
