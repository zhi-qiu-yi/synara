/**
 * AcpTurnIdleWatchdog - idle-progress backstop for ACP provider turns.
 *
 * ACP providers (Grok, Cursor) drive a turn by issuing a single `session/prompt`
 * JSON-RPC request to the child agent. That request only settles when the agent
 * finishes the turn. If the child stays alive but goes silent — wedged on an
 * internal retry loop, a stalled upstream API call, or a deadlock — the request
 * never settles, no `turn.completed` is ever emitted, and the UI shows
 * "Working" forever (observed in the wild as a turn stuck for 15+ hours).
 *
 * A process *crash* mid-prompt is already handled (the transport fails the
 * pending request). This watchdog covers the remaining gap: the alive-but-hung
 * child. It is a fail-safe for hangs, NOT a wall-clock cap on legitimate long
 * turns — any inbound ACP activity resets it, and it pauses entirely while the
 * turn is legitimately blocked on a human approval.
 *
 * @module AcpTurnIdleWatchdog
